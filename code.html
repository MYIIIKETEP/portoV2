and functionality that JS are capable of. I am inlove with logical chains that are easy to build and use. Cookies, localStorage,

p2="I really did enjoy the PHP course we had in school. PHP alone is a very strong coding language,
but the real power of it is Backend. I personnaly love to play with back-end, all the MySQL and DB stuff.
I loved to work with Slim 3 that is API creation tool, that lets you create API with php and MySQL and
later on you can use it with JS code to build a website/shop/you name it."

p3="I have to tell you that I hate design, all that pixel hunting, animation thing.
But if I have to manage those, I will do it properly, on my max level of knowledge.
All the keyframe, AnimeJS animations and Chart.js , all of those I have in my arsenal."
